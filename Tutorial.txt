How To Figure out Possitive and negetive legs:

To Find LEDs the longer one is Possitive and the shorter one is negetive.

For Buzzers on top of the buzzer there is a little + over one of the legs that one is possitive.

For DC motors it doesnt matter except if you want it to spin a specific direction so you just plug it in one way it goes that way and. other way makes it go the other direction.

Resistors work both ways.

Batterys Red = Possitive Black = Negative

Servos you can search it up but you need a controller for it.

To Find Diagrams look at the PNGs.
